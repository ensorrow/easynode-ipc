1. cd easynode-icp; webpack-dev-server --content-base plugins

6. You can enable some codes only in development environment with environment flags

	env DEBUG=true weback

7. Code splitting

	For big wen apps it's not efficient to put all code into a single file.  Webpack allows you to split them into serveral chunks.

	Especially if some blocks of code are only required under some circumstances. these chunks could be loaded on demand

* on demand

    copy 1.../build/1.js to views directory, now the page'll work.

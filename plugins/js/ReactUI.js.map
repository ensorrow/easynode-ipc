USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.\n *\n * PinkySwear is a very small implementation of the Promises/A+ specification. After compilation with the\n * Google Closure Compiler and gzipping it weighs less than 500 bytes. It is based on the implementation for \n * Minified.js and should be perfect for embedding. \n *\n *\n * PinkySwear has just three functions.\n *\n * To create a new promise in pending state, call pinkySwear():\n *         var promise = pinkySwear();\n *\n * The returned object has a Promises/A+ compatible then() implementation:\n *          promise.then(function(value) { alert(\"Success!\"); }, function(value) { alert(\"Failure!\"); });\n *\n *\n * The promise returned by pinkySwear() is a function. To fulfill the promise, call the function with true as first argument and\n * an optional array of values to pass to the then() handler. By putting more than one value in the array, you can pass more than one\n * value to the then() handlers. Here an example to fulfill a promsise, this time with only one argument: \n *         promise(true, [42]);\n *\n * When the promise has been rejected, call it with false. Again, there may be more than one argument for the then() handler:\n *         promise(true, [6, 6, 6]);\n *         \n * You can obtain the promise's current state by calling the function without arguments.
